Welcome fren, to the code repository of the The Lenft Protocol!

https://lenftprotocol.xyz (site under construction)

Our technical architecture consists of two parts:
* the backend smart contract code, which is hosted on the blockchain
* the frontend+backend website code, which is hosted on a server

The smart contracts are in the `contracts` folder, along with more detailed instructions.

The website code is in the `web` folder, along with more detailed instructions.
